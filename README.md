# Pricepoint
A platform for millennial investors

Today, millennials are being underserved by financial institutions. They have some money and want to invest, but might not know what to invest in or the right asset allocation. They would like to talk to a somebody like a certified financial planner, but they might not have a lot of assets to justify the cost. They're also not confident in the stock market so they might leave their money in a low interest earning account. With Pricepoint, young investors can schedule a meeting with a certified financial planner at a co-working space of their choosing. 

It helps financial planners by not having to pay the overhead cost of maintaining an office space. As a result, they're able to provide the same service at a lower price point. It also allows small businesses to generate more leads without having to spend money on advertising or marketing. As a result, both the customer and financial planner get benefits out of the meeting and the transaction is facilitated with the visa API.
